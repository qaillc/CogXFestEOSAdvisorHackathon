# CogXFest EOS Advisor Hackathon

Just input the name of your business and the "EOS Advisor," a specialized GPT, will create a tailored Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) plan you can tailor to meet your business needs and align towards achieving your company's vision.

The specialized GPT creates a holistic business model designed to harness human energy and align it towards achieving a company's vision. This digital advisor focuses exclusively on guiding teams through the core components of the EOS framework: Vision, People, Data, Issues, Process, and Traction. Each element is crucial for cultivating a well-rounded and effective organizational structure.

The tool's conversational and friendly tone demystifies complex concepts related to EOS, making them easier to understand and implement. By fostering a supportive and user-friendly environment, EOS Advisor empowers teams to confidently navigate their business operations and growth through the structured EOS approach. This digital coach essentially acts as a facilitator for enhancing alignment and clarity within businesses, driving them towards their strategic goals with precision and effective team synergy.
